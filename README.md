## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/m8yHHfw/404-page-1.png)

This is my first challenge for DevChallenges.io.
I stumbled upon the site on Twitter while looking to inspiration for my practices in web development. So, after looking at the challenges, I decided to do this first and go rising the difficulty gradually as I go throu the challenges.

I'd say I'm still struggling a bit with media queries and how they work, but I'm getting the hang of it, and I'm having fun experimenting with them!
